# Prayer app

## Design

### Data modeling
A lot of the data seems to be described in the form of the [TEI Manuscript Description](https://tei-c.org/release/doc/tei-p5-doc/en/html/MS.html) element and its associated subelements.

### Architecture
I am compiling [a list of various libraries under consideration](https://github.com/stars/simongray/lists/when-danes-prayed-in-german).
